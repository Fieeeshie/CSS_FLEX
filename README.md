# Mobile Legends Fan Page - CSS Flexbox Documentation 
This documentation describes the use of CSS Flexbox properties to create a responsive and visually appealing layout for the Mobile Legends Fan Page. Flexbox provides a flexible and efficient way to align and arrange elements, ensuring that the page adapts well across different screen sizes and devices.

### Home Page Layout
• Header: The header spans the entire width of the page and contains navigation links that are centrally aligned. The links have hover effects to improve user interactivity.
• Main Content: The main content includes a hero-cards layout and an introductory section. Flexbox is used here to arrange the event cards in a responsive manner, ensuring that the cards wrap and 
  stack depending on the screen size.
• Footer: The footer is styled with a gradient background and padding, ensuring it visually separates from the main content while maintaining a cohesive design.

  When viewed on larger screens, the layout displays in a row-wise fashion, whereas on smaller screens, Flexbox ensures that the content adjusts, stacking elements as necessary.

### Heroes Page Layout
The heroes.html page provides a list of Mobile Legends heroes, each with an image, role, and description. Flexbox plays a key role in the page layout to ensure the content remains flexible and responsive.

• Hero Cards Layout: The hero cards are placed in a flex container. On larger screens, the cards are displayed side-by-side in a row. On smaller screens, they wrap automatically to fit within the 
  container's width.
• Center Alignment: Flexbox ensures that all content, including the hero images and text, is centered within their containers.
• Responsiveness: The layout adapts to screen size, ensuring that the hero cards remain readable and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.

With Flexbox, the hero cards remain well-organized and responsive, delivering an optimal user experience across various devices.

### Guides Page Layout
The guides.html page provides strategies and tips for playing Beatrix, a marksman hero in Mobile Legends. Flexbox ensures that each section of the guide, including tips, builds, and videos, is well-structured and responsive.

• Guide Sections Layout: Flexbox is applied to each section—gameplay tips, recommended builds, and video sections—to ensure the content is vertically aligned and spaced appropriately.
• Video Embedding: A YouTube video showcasing Beatrix’s gameplay is embedded and centered using Flexbox, ensuring it aligns correctly on all screen sizes.
• Text and Lists: Text sections, including gameplay tips and recommended builds, are arranged vertically for easy readability. Each list is spaced and aligned using Flexbox to maintain a clean layout.
