Mobile Legends Fan Page - CSS Flexbox Documentation
This documentation describes the use of CSS Flexbox properties in creating a responsive, visually appealing layout for the Mobile Legends Fan Page. Flexbox enables flexible and efficient arrangements of elements, particularly for handling alignment, spacing, and responsive behavior across screen sizes.

Project Overview
The Mobile Legends Fan Page includes a header, main content section, and footer. It serves as an informational webpage, with a specific focus on Mobile Legends news, guides, and updates. CSS Flexbox is used throughout to structure the layout and enhance user experience on various devices.

The webpage uses a flex-based layout, applying centered alignment and column stacking for the body, a full-width header with centered navigation links and hover effects, a main content section with a centered, readable container and semi-transparent guide-section, a responsive hero-cards layout that wraps and centers cards with interactive hover effects, and a footer styled with a gradient and padding for cohesive design and separation.

When rendered, the Mobile Legends Fan Page has a structured, responsive layout that adjusts gracefully across screen sizes. Key elements, such as the header, main content area, and hero cards, are aligned centrally, giving a balanced and clean appearance. The flexible design ensures that even on small screens, content remains accessible and visually appealing, with cards and navigation elements adapting to maintain usability.
